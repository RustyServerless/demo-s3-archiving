# Swift contender — `sebsto-soto`

A single-Lambda implementation of the
[demo-s3-archiving](../../README.md) benchmark contract: given a
`{bucket_name, files_prefix, archive_key}` input, list every object
under `s3://${bucket_name}/${files_prefix}/`, fetch them all, build a
flat **STORED** ZIP archive, and upload that archive to
`s3://${bucket_name}/${archive_key}` — all in one invocation, on a
512 MB / arm64 / `provided.al2023` Lambda with a 600 s timeout.

The benchmark bucket holds 3 000 objects totalling ~15 GB. The 512 MB
memory ceiling means we cannot buffer the archive on disk or in memory;
everything must stream.

This README walks through the design choices, the architecture, the
tunables, and the measured performance against the Rust reference
contender that ships in the same repo.

## Per-Lambda configuration

| Setting | Value |
|---|---|
| Runtime | `provided.al2023` |
| Architecture | `arm64` (Graviton) |
| Memory | 512 MB (~0.29 vCPU) |
| Timeout | 600 s |
| Handler | `swift.handler` (ignored — `bootstrap` is executed) |

## Two performance design decisions

### 1. Use Soto, not the official AWS SDK for Swift

Two AWS SDKs exist for Swift:

- **The official [AWS SDK for Swift](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-sdk-swift)**
  — built on top of the
  [AWS Common Runtime (`aws-crt-swift`)](https://github.com/awslabs/aws-crt-swift),
  a set of C libraries shared across the official SDKs for several
  languages (Java, Python, JavaScript, …). Generated from the same
  Smithy service models as those other SDKs.
- **[Soto](https://github.com/soto-project/soto)** — a community SDK
  built on top of [SwiftNIO](https://github.com/apple/swift-nio) and
  [AsyncHTTPClient](https://github.com/swift-server/async-http-client),
  Apple's official server-side Swift HTTP stack. Pure Swift end-to-end.

Measured with the same Swift application code on top of each SDK,
running the same workload on the same Lambda configuration:

| SDK | Cold-1 wall-clock | Cold-2 wall-clock | `uploadPart` p50 |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Soto** | **250 s** | **250 s** | **200 ms** |
| AWS SDK for Swift | 544 s | timeout @ 600 s | 680 ms |

Same three-stage pipeline, same byte budget, same chunk size, same
pure-Swift CRC32, same backpressure model — only the SDK calls differ.
The aws-sdk-swift port runs **at the edge of the 600 s Lambda timeout**:
it succeeds once and times out the next time. Not viable for production.

The gap is at the HTTP transport layer:

- **`S3.uploadPart` is 3.4× slower per call** on aws-crt-swift than on
  AsyncHTTPClient (680 ms vs 200 ms p50 for a 10 MiB part). With ~1 500
  parts per archive, that single difference accounts for ~700 s of
  extra work.
- **The API surface forces extra copies.** aws-sdk-swift exposes the S3
  response body as `Smithy.ByteStream`, whose only progressive read
  primitive is `readAsync(upToCount:)` returning a fresh `Data`. The
  upload body is `ByteStream.data(Data?)` or `.stream(Stream)` — no
  ByteBuffer init. Any custom `Stream` is collected back into a single
  `Data` by `FlexibleChecksumsRequestMiddleware` before SigV4 signing,
  so even manual bridging cannot avoid the copy. Combined with `Data`'s
  allocation behaviour (see decision #2), this multiplies CRT-internal
  memcpys.

Soto, by contrast, hands us NIO `ByteBuffer` end-to-end and accepts
`ByteBuffer` zero-copy on `S3.uploadPart` via `AWSHTTPBody(buffer:)`.
That is decision #2.

### 2. Use NIO `ByteBuffer` instead of Foundation `Data`

If you don't write Swift on the server every day, this distinction is
not obvious. Both look like "an array of bytes". Why does it matter?

**`Foundation.Data`** is the standard Swift "blob of bytes" type. It is
copy-on-write, like Swift's `Array`, and it is **opaque about its
storage**: an instance may be backed by one contiguous heap allocation,
or by several disjoint segments stitched together at the API surface.
The hot-path consequences:

- Every `Data.append(other:)` checks whether the receiver is uniquely
  referenced (cheap), grows the backing buffer if needed (potentially
  reallocating and copying the existing bytes), then memcpys the new
  bytes into place.
- When you ask for a contiguous pointer (`withUnsafeBytes`), Foundation
  may have to flatten the segments first — copying bytes you didn't
  ask to copy.
- It carries Foundation's bridging surface — `NSData`, Objective-C
  interop, even on Linux where there is no Objective-C runtime.

**`NIOCore.ByteBuffer`** is the byte-buffer type used inside SwiftNIO.
Also value-typed and copy-on-write, but with three crucial differences
for our workload:

- **One contiguous allocation, always.** A ByteBuffer is a slice over
  exactly one underlying buffer. `withUnsafeReadableBytes` always hands
  back a single contiguous pointer-and-length, no flattening needed.
- **Reader index + writer index.** Splitting a ByteBuffer
  (`readSlice(length:)`) and concatenating
  (`writeBuffer(&other:)`) advance internal indices over the same
  storage. Slicing is zero-copy; concatenation is a single memcpy.
- **Allocator-aware.** The default `ByteBufferAllocator` recycles
  storage from a per-event-loop arena, so high-throughput pipelines
  pay much less malloc/free overhead than `Data` does on its general
  allocator.

In our pipeline this matters at three places:

| Hot-path location | Cost using `Data` | What `ByteBuffer` saves |
|---|---|---|
| Download accumulator (`downloadFile`) | One `Data.append(_:count:)` per ~64 KB frame, ~250k frames per run, with possible re-allocation as the buffer grows | One pre-sized allocation per file, one `writeBuffer` memcpy per frame |
| Producer→uploader chunk (`ChunkProducer`) | Each 10 MiB chunk built via `Data.append`; passed to `S3.uploadPart` as `Data` | Built directly in a 10 MiB `ByteBuffer`; passed as `AWSHTTPBody(buffer:)` zero-copy |
| `S3.uploadPart` body | `AWSHTTPBody(bytes: Data)` copies into a fresh `ByteBuffer` internally before NIO emits it on the wire | `AWSHTTPBody(buffer:)` wraps the existing ByteBuffer with no copy |

Switching from `Data` to `ByteBuffer` on the upload path alone
eliminates ~15 GiB of avoidable copies per run (10 MiB × ~1 500 parts)
and reduces NIO `ByteBufferAllocator` arena pressure (which would
otherwise make the warm Lambda's RSS climb).

If `Data` is your shovel, `ByteBuffer` is the conveyor belt — designed
for moving lots of bytes through one pipe.

## Architecture

A three-stage streaming pipeline. All three stages run as sibling
`async let` children of a single `runPipeline` task; if any throws, the
others are cancelled.

### Stage A — Downloader (`runDownloadStage` in `Archiver.swift`)

A `withThrowingTaskGroup` of N worker tasks. Concurrency is bounded by
the byte budget: a new download task is added only after
`byteBudget.acquire(file.size)` succeeds, so at any moment the in-flight
set fits in 20 MiB. With ~5 MB files, that gives ~4 concurrent tasks
in steady state.

Each task:

- Calls `s3.getObject` (Soto returns an `AWSHTTPBody`, which is an
  `AsyncSequence<ByteBuffer>` over the response body).
- Pre-allocates one `ByteBuffer` of exactly `expectedSize` bytes.
- Iterates the body and `writeBuffer(&frame)`s each frame into the
  accumulator — one memcpy per frame, no re-allocation.
- After the body is fully read, runs CRC32 once over the contiguous
  readable view (see CRC32 below).
- Sends a `DownloadedFile { name, buffer, crc32, releaseBytes }` into
  the `FileChannel` — a thin `AsyncStream` wrapper.

### Stage B — Zipper (`runZipStage` in `Archiver.swift`)

Single consumer of `FileChannel.stream`. Files arrive in download
completion order, not list order — that's fine because the central
directory is built from the order observed.

Per file:

- Emits local-file-header (LFH) + body bytes + data descriptor (DD)
  into the `ChunkProducer` via `appendCompound(lfh:body:dataDescriptor:)`.
- Releases the byte budget so a downloader can resume.
- Records the entry in the central-directory entries array.

After all files: the zipper builds the central directory, ZIP64 EOCD,
ZIP64 EOCD locator, and EOCD; appends each into the chunk producer in
order; calls `producer.finish()`.

### Stage C — Uploader (`runUploadStage` in `Archiver.swift`)

A `withThrowingTaskGroup` of up to `Tunables.maxConcurrentUploads = 3`
in-flight `S3.uploadPart` calls. After each upload completes, calls
`producer.releaseSlot()` so the producer can build more chunks. The
final list of `S3.CompletedPart` is returned to `runArchiveJob`, which
calls `S3.completeMultipartUpload`.

### `ChunkProducer` (`ChunkProducer.swift`)

Swift `actor`. Buckets writes from the zipper into fixed-size 10 MiB
chunks and emits each sealed chunk on a
`nonisolated AsyncStream<UploadChunk>` for the uploader.

- Internal buffer is a `ByteBuffer` sized exactly to `chunkSize`.
- Two append overloads — `Data` (for the small ZIP headers) and
  `ByteBuffer` (for the big file bodies, zero-copy).
- Backpressure: at most `bufferChunksCount = 2` chunks may be
  outstanding. The producer suspends in `waitForSlot()` when the
  in-flight count is at the ceiling.

### Backpressure summary

Three independent budgets keep the 512 MB Lambda within memory:

| Budget | Mechanism | Capacity |
|---|---|---|
| In-flight downloads | `ByteSemaphore` over file sizes | 20 MiB |
| Producer-buffered chunks | `ChunkProducer.maxInFlight` | 2 chunks × 10 MiB = 20 MiB |
| Concurrent uploads | TaskGroup size cap | 3 |

These are not additive on the hot path — once a file is fully
downloaded and its bytes have been memcpy'd into the chunk producer,
the byte budget is released and the producer owns the bytes.

## Tunables (`Pipeline.swift`)

```swift
enum Tunables {
    static let maxDownloadsMemory: Int = 20 * 1024 * 1024   // 20 MiB
    static let maxConcurrentUploads: Int = 3
    static let chunkSize: Int = 10 * 1024 * 1024            // 10 MiB
    static let bufferChunksCount: Int = 2                   // ChunkProducer in-flight ceiling
}
```

The HTTP client connection pool is configured in `main.swift` because
it must be set on AsyncHTTPClient before the AWSClient is built:

```swift
httpConfig.connectionPool.concurrentHTTP1ConnectionsPerHostSoftLimit = 32
httpConfig.timeout.read = .seconds(120)
httpConfig.timeout.connect = .seconds(10)
```

## ZIP format

STORED only (no DEFLATE), GP flag bit 3 set so CRC32 + sizes are
emitted in a data descriptor *after* each file body. ZIP64 records are
emitted unconditionally because the archive total exceeds 4 GiB.

| Record | Size | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Local file header (LFH) | 30 + nameLen | sig, version 45, GP flag 0x0008, method STORED (0), DOS time/date (fixed 2010-01-01), CRC=0, compSize=0, uncSize=0, nameLen, extraLen=0, name |
| Data descriptor (ZIP64) | 24 | sig, CRC32, 8B compSize, 8B uncSize (== compSize because STORED) |
| Central directory record | 46 + nameLen + 28 | Last 28 bytes are the ZIP64 extended-info extra field (uncSize8, compSize8, lfhOffset8). The 32-bit fields in the CD record are set to `0xFFFFFFFF` to force readers to use the ZIP64 extra. |
| ZIP64 EOCD record | 56 | sig, sizeOfRest=44, version, disk numbers, entry count (×2), CD size, CD offset |
| ZIP64 EOCD locator | 20 | sig, disk=0, ZIP64-EOCD offset, totalDisks=1 |
| EOCD | 22 | All counts/offsets are `0xFFFF` / `0xFFFFFFFF` (defer to ZIP64) |

Filenames are pure ASCII (SHA-256 hex, 64 chars), so no UTF-8 GP-flag
tweaks are required. There are no directory entries and no extra fields
beyond the mandatory ZIP64 one. All implementation lives in
`Sources/SwiftSebstoSoto/Zip/Headers.swift`.

## CRC32

Pure-Swift slicing-by-8 implementation in `Zip/CRC32.swift`. ~125 LOC,
no C dependency, no platform intrinsics. The IEEE polynomial
(`0xEDB88320` reflected), as used by ZIP/zlib.

Why not the ARMv8 `__crc32{b,h,w,d}` hardware intrinsics (which would
require a tiny C shim)? Two reasons:

- **Single-language comparison.** The Rust reference contender uses the
  pure-Rust `zip` crate's CRC. Calling out to C would muddy the
  Swift-vs-Rust comparison.
- **It is faster on this CPU.** The `__crc32d` intrinsic has a serial
  dependency chain (each call depends on the previous CRC result).
  Slicing-by-8 issues 8 parallel table lookups per byte position,
  which the out-of-order core on Graviton schedules across multiple
  memory ports. On a 0.29 vCPU allocation the memory-level parallelism
  wins: ~4 ms per 5 MB file in pure Swift vs ~76 ms with the intrinsics
  + the Swift→C boundary cost on a non-contiguous source.

The implementation is verified against standard reference vectors:
empty, `"a"`, `"123456789"` (= `0xCBF43926`, RFC 3720), 32×0x00,
32×0xFF, chunked splits, and a 1 MiB cross-check against a slicing-by-1
reference.

## Optional profiling instrumentation — `STATS=1`

`Stats.swift` defines a `final class Stats` (lock-protected via
`NIOLockedValueBox`) that records per-stage durations and aggregate
gauges, and emits a per-stage report at the end of a run.

| Stage | What it measures |
|---|---|
| `downloadFile` | total time inside the per-task body iteration + CRC |
| `downloadInFrame` | time of the single CRC pass at end of file |
| `zipperQueueWait` | time the zipper waits for the next downloaded file |
| `zipperAppend` | time inside `producer.appendCompound` |
| `uploadPart` | time inside `S3.uploadPart` |
| `uploaderQueueWait` | time the uploader waits for the next sealed chunk |
| `downloadInFlight` | time-weighted mean + max concurrent download tasks |
| `producerHops` | counter of `ChunkProducer.appendCompound` actor hops |
| `peakRSS` | end-of-run `getrusage(RUSAGE_SELF).ru_maxrss` |

Gated on the `STATS` environment variable — truthy values are `1`,
`true`, `yes` (case-insensitive). `Stats.enabled` is read once at cold
start. When unset, every call site short-circuits via an inlined
`if Stats.enabled` check — neither `monoNs()` nor `record()` runs, no
allocation, no actor hop, no lock acquisition. Enabling instrumentation
adds ~10–25 s to a full run.

To enable for one run:

```bash
aws lambda update-function-configuration \
  --function-name demo-s3-archiving-swift-sebsto-soto \
  --environment 'Variables={STATS=1}'
```

Then trigger the Step Function and read the stats from CloudWatch Logs
at the end of the run. Switch back off afterwards.

The clock is `clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC)` via a platform-conditional
libc import (`Darwin.C`, `Glibc`, `Musl`) — see `monoNs()` in
`Stats.swift`. Reading it costs ~30 ns per call.

## Stack decisions (summary table)

| Concern | Decision | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Lambda runtime | `swift-aws-lambda-runtime` v2.x | Closure-based `LambdaRuntime { (event, context) in … }`, Codable JSON in/out |
| **AWS SDK** | **Soto 7.x** (community) | NIO `ByteBuffer` end-to-end, zero-copy upload via `AWSHTTPBody(buffer:)`. The official aws-sdk-swift forces `Data` everywhere and times out on this workload — see "Two performance design decisions" above |
| **Byte buffer** | **NIO `ByteBuffer`** | Single contiguous allocation, reader/writer indices, allocator-pooled; vs Foundation `Data`'s opaque storage and per-`append` re-allocation risk |
| ZIP writer | Hand-rolled (`Zip/Headers.swift`) | ZIPFoundation requires a URL or full-`Data` backing — incompatible with 15 GB-doesn't-fit-in-/tmp streaming. ~150 LOC of Swift gets us streaming + ZIP64 |
| CRC32 | Pure-Swift slicing-by-8 | Single-language vs Rust comparison; faster than the ARMv8 intrinsic on this CPU due to memory-level parallelism (see CRC32 section) |
| Foundation | `FoundationEssentials` on Linux (`#if canImport(FoundationEssentials)`), `Foundation` on macOS for local builds | Smaller binary on Linux |
| Architecture | arm64 (Graviton) | Matches Rust reference; cheaper per GB-s |
| Memory | 512 MB | Same as Rust reference. Peak observed ~390 MB |
| Concurrency | Swift 6 strict concurrency, structured `withThrowingTaskGroup`, actors for shared state, `AsyncStream` for inter-stage queues |

## Build & deploy

The CI is `ci-config/buildspec.yml`. Relevant block (the `# SWIFT BUILD`
section):

```bash
SWIFT_CONTENDER_LAMBDA_PATH=./contenders/swift
for LAMBDA_DIR in "$SWIFT_CONTENDER_LAMBDA_PATH"/*/; do
  [ -d "$LAMBDA_DIR" ] || continue            # skip sibling files (this README, etc.)
  LAMBDA=$(basename "$LAMBDA_DIR")
  cd $SWIFT_CONTENDER_LAMBDA_PATH/$LAMBDA
  swift build -c release --static-swift-stdlib -Xswiftc -Osize
  BIN=$(swift build -c release --static-swift-stdlib --show-bin-path)/bootstrap
  strip "$BIN" || true
  cp "$BIN" /tmp/bootstrap-$LAMBDA
  cd $CODEBUILD_SRC_DIR
  find $SWIFT_CONTENDER_LAMBDA_PATH/$LAMBDA -mindepth 1 -delete
  mv /tmp/bootstrap-$LAMBDA $SWIFT_CONTENDER_LAMBDA_PATH/$LAMBDA/bootstrap
done
```

Notes:

- The Swift toolchain (`swift-6.3.2-RELEASE` for `amazonlinux2023-aarch64`)
  is installed in the `install` phase, with the tarball cached under
  `.swift-cache/` and verified against the Swift signing GPG key.
- `--static-swift-stdlib` builds bundle the Swift runtime into the binary
  so the Lambda doesn't need a Swift layer.
- After build, the contender directory is **emptied** and replaced by a
  single `bootstrap` binary — that is what `aws cloudformation package`
  zips.
- SwiftPM build artefacts are persisted via the CodeBuild S3 cache
  (`contenders/swift/*/.build/**/*`) so warm rebuilds are fast.

## CFN registration (`templates/contenders.yml`)

```yaml
SwiftSebstoSotoFunction:
  Type: AWS::Serverless::Function
  Properties:
    FunctionName: !Sub ${ProjectName}-swift-sebsto-soto
    CodeUri: ../contenders/swift/sebsto-soto
    Runtime: provided.al2023
    MemorySize: 512
    Timeout: 600
    Architectures: [arm64]
    Handler: swift.handler   # ignored by provided.al2023
    Role: !GetAtt LambdaContenderRole.Arn
```

The function ARN is added to the `ContenderArns` output between the
`BEGIN/END CONTENDER ARN LIST` markers so the Step Function picks it
up.

## Results

10 sequential Step Function executions, each invoking both the Swift
contender and the Rust reference. Same Lambda configuration for both
(512 MB / arm64 / 600 s timeout), in eu-west-3, on the same 3 000-object
/ ~15 GB test bucket. STATS instrumentation off. All 10 runs succeeded.

### Reading the numbers

- **The best Swift run was 0.7 s slower than its paired Rust run** —
  within sampling noise (run 4: 212.4 s vs 211.7 s).
- **The median Swift run is 1.039× Rust** — about 8 s slower on a
  211 s baseline.
- **Swift's mean cost is 5.7% higher than Rust** ($0.001489 vs
  $0.001409 per invocation).
- **Rust is metronomic, Swift is variable.** Rust's wall-clock
  standard deviation across 10 runs is **0.52 s**; Swift's is
  **9.13 s**. The Swift variance correlates with sandbox cold-vs-warm
  placement — the high outliers are colder cases, and a statically
  linked Rust binary's cold start is short enough that it's invisible
  at this granularity.

## Verification

1. **CI build passes**: CodePipeline shows the Swift build block produced
   a `bootstrap`.
2. **Stack deployed**: the root stack reaches `CREATE_COMPLETE` with the
   Swift function ARN in `ContenderArns`.
3. **Successful invocation**: triggering the Step Function with the
   published `ContenderArns` produces the contender under `success` (not
   `failure`) in the ranked output.
4. **Control-Lambda check**: the in-state-machine control Lambda
   re-hashes the ZIP entries via SHA-256 and validates entry-name ==
   SHA-256(content). A failure here appears as
   `invalid: content hash mismatch`.
5. **Memory check**: CloudWatch `Max Memory Used` should be < 512 MB.
   Anything ≥ 480 MB is on the edge of OOM.
